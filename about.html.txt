    <h2>About Me – Agasthya C.V</h2>

    <h3>Personal Philosophy</h3>
    <p>I didn’t start my career with a roadmap — I started with responsibility. And I’ve carried that mindset through every transition since.</p>

    <h3>Career Milestones (2011–2025)</h3>
    <div class="timeline">
      <p><strong>2011:</strong> Began in recruitment, learning the nuances of people, fit, and long-term alignment.</p>
      <p><strong>2015–2017:</strong> Moved into customer service and case management — especially leave management and compliance, handling sensitive employee escalations.</p>
      <p><strong>2018–2021:</strong> Became a Team Manager at Amazon. Led onboarding, managed KPIs, coached peers, and initiated improvement programs.</p>
      <p><strong>2021–2023:</strong> Transition Lead at Accenture for Verizon. Delivered large-scale onboarding programs, drove stakeholder connects, resolved deployment blockers.</p>
      <p><strong>2023–2025:</strong> Upskilled in Agile/Scrum, led cross-functional collaboration, and laid the groundwork for program-level delivery responsibility.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Agile Journey</h3>
    <p>I pursued certifications in Scrum (CSM) and SAFe not just for titles — but to create structure behind my leadership instincts. I've supported teams in backlog grooming, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning. Even before having a formal Scrum Master title, I was practicing the mindset.</p>

    <h3>Tech Stack Exposure</h3>
    <p>I'm not a developer, but I’ve gained hands-on experience across tools and frameworks to support my delivery responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML, CSS</li>
      <li>GitHub, VS Code</li>
      <li>Netlify (deployment & CI/CD basics)</li>
      <li>Jira, Confluence, Trello</li>
      <li>Slack, Supabase, basic API integration flow</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why I Built This Site</h3>
    <p>This site wasn’t built to show off. It was built to look back. It holds the stories I’ve learned from, the case studies I’ve lived through, and the potential I now carry — not just to manage work, but to lead programs, improve systems, and empower people.</p>
