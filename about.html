      <h2 style="text-align: center;">From Recruiter to Case Manager – My Journey</h2>

      <p>
        I began my career in 2011 as a recruiter, working closely with candidates and understanding the real dynamics of matching talent to opportunities. From there, my path evolved into managing customer service teams, case operations, and eventually becoming a Team Manager at Amazon, handling both people and performance across various geographies.
      </p>

      <p>
        My ability to solve people and process issues, create feedback loops, and influence onboarding and learning outcomes naturally shaped me into a delivery-focused leader. I discovered Agile methodologies along the way, not as buzzwords — but as practical approaches to fixing what was broken, improving what could be better, and scaling what worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        My learning didn’t stop at leadership. I ventured into Scrum, earned certifications, and even built this very website myself using <strong>HTML, CSS, GitHub, Netlify, and VS Code</strong>. Through real-time collaboration, I explored how tech and content come together — this page being a living proof of that hands-on journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m not just someone who’s led operations. I’m a strategic executor, deeply invested in learning, building, and sharing. Whether it's aligning teams to outcomes or presenting ideas through storytelling — my journey continues, and this portal is one stop along the way.
